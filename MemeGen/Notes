Questions

1. How to display the Meme Editor view controller first given my structure of

    Tab bar Controller > Navigation controller > TableView / CollectionView controllers

2. Adding text to Meme Detail VC:

    Is the idea to just display the memed image in the meme detail view where the text is part of the image already, or to create labels and render them positioned over the image?

        I'm finding the latter difficult - finding the position of the top of the aspect fit image

3. Clear background on text field in Meme Editor view - I'm having success using white background, but not clearColor for the background. Created textView using storyboard editor, then set text attributes in code. Is that allowed? Am I setting the text in the correct method?
